# 🚀 How to Put Your Site Online (Free)

You can launch your site in about 2 minutes using **Netlify Drop**. It's free, no account card needed, and super easy.

## Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest) 🏆

1.  **Prepare your Folder**:
    *   Find your project folder: `celestial-aldrin`.
    *   Make sure it has `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, etc. inside.

2.  **Go to Netlify**:
    *   Open [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).

3.  **Drag & Drop**:
    *   Simply drag your **entire `celestial-aldrin` folder** onto the page where it says "Drag and drop your site output folder here".

4.  **Wait & Click**:
    *   It will upload in seconds.
    *   Once done, you'll see a link like `random-name-123456.netlify.app`.
    *   **Click it**. Your site is now online! 🌍

5.  **Rename (Optional)**:
    *   Sign up for a free Netlify account to change the URL to something like `abhimanyu-visuals.netlify.app`.

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Professional) 💼

If you want a more "developer" approach and have a GitHub account:

1.  Create a **New Repository** on GitHub (name it `portfolio`).
2.  Upload your files to it.
3.  Go to **Settings > Pages**.
4.  Under "Source", select **Branch: main**.
5.  Click **Save**.
6.  Wait 1-2 minutes, and your site will be live at `yourusername.github.io/portfolio`.

## IMPORTANT NOTE ⚠️

**Google Sheets Connection**:
Because your site reads from Google Sheets, it works **better** online than on your computer! You won't need to worry about "CORS" errors anymore. The connection will be stable and fast.
